# PyTorchBasics
This repository was coded while learning to use PyTorch from [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org). The video for this is in [PyTorch for Deep Learning - Full Course / Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIsg-ZUy0MY). 
The notebook `Learning_PyTorch.ipynb` contains a basic introduction to PyTorch with topics like:
1. Basic introduction to Tensors
2. Gradients from Tensors
3. Interoperability with Numpy
